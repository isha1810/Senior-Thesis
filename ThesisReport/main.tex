\section{Introduction}
Gravitational-wave detectors such as LIGO and VIRGO, have
detected Gravitational Waves (GWs) radiated from compact object
coalescences, such as binary black hole (BBH) systems and binary
black hole neutron star systems (NSBH) systems. The data from
these detectors contain a large amount of noise in which the
gravitational wave signals are buried. In order to extract these
signals, the process of matched filtering is used, where a set of
template waveforms is compared with the detector data. Hence, the
detection of gravitational waves depends on the template waveforms
chosen for the matched filtering. 

The efficiency of the template bank in recovering signals from data
depends on the density of template waveforms in the parameter space
and the waveforms themselves.
Full numerical simulations of all the waveforms
in the bank are not possible because of the computational cost of
the simulations. Hence, approximants such as Post-Newtonian
(PN) and Effective One Body (EOB) formalism are used to construct
these waveforms. The use of these inexact waveforms can reduce
the detection rate of GWs. Additionally, these template waveforms
usually consist only of the dominant quadrupolar mode.
This reduces the likelihood of detection of GWs from binary systems with high mass ratios and spin, which contain observable contributions from sub-dominant modes (as observed in GW190814).

So, in order to detect these spinning high mass-ratio binary systems, it is important to understand the waveform models most appropriate to these regions in parameter space, especially the effect of including higher modes in template waveforms. Precession of the orbital plane would also increase the contribution of higher order multipoles in the GW detected. Since high mass ratio binaries are detected with low SNR, the use of only quadrupole waveforms for detection further decreases the SNR. This effect is reflected in the GW detected by LIGO/VIRGO. Hence, in order to increase the detect rate of such GWs, it is crucial to measure the effect of different waveform models, including higher order multipoles, on the detection of systems with high mass-ratios, spin and precession.


\section{Gravitational Waves from Coalescing Binaries}

    \label{fig:GWFrameParams}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:GWFrameParams} shows the
source and detector frames and important angles.  The inclination
angle $\iota$ is the angle between the line connecting the detector
and source and the total angular momentum of the binary $\vec{J}$. The angle $\phi_0$ is the phase angle of the binary evolution and depends on the starting point. The angles $\theta$ and $\phi$ give
the position of the binary in the sky in the frame of the detector.
$\psi$ is the third euler angle used to relate the binary frame to the detector frame. 

A gravitational waveform is represented
as a time-series function $h(t)$, where $h$ is written in terms of
the plus and cross polarizations,
\begin{equation}
    h(t) = h_{+}(t) + ih_{\times}(t). \label{ComplexTimeSeries}
\end{equation}
This can be written in terms of spin-weighted spherical harmonic functions,
\begin{equation}
    h(t) = \sum_{l=2}^{\infty} \sum_{m=-l}^{l} Y^{-2}_{lm}(\theta, \phi) \; h_{lm}(t) \label{SpinWheighted}
\end{equation}
The $Y^{-2}_{lm}$s are functions of the inclination angle and phase. The $l=2$, $m=2$ mode corresponds to the quadrupole mode,
which is dominant in gravitational radiation.

\section{Detection of Gravitational Waves}
\subsection{Matched filtering}
The gravitational wave data from detectors can be represented as,
\begin{equation}
    d(t) = n(t) + h(t) ,\label{GWData}
\end{equation}
where $n(t)$ is the background noise and $h(t)$ is the gravitational waveform signal. In order to identify these signals from the data, the data is match filtered with a set of theoretical waveforms called the template bank.
The noise $n(t)$ typically consists of transient noise signals and some Gaussian noise sources (such as thermal and seismic noise). Although the noise is not actually Gaussian over long periods of time, the Gaussian assumption can be made for short periods of time to estimate the power spectral density (PSD) of the noise $S_n(f)$. 
The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $\rho$ is used to quantify the match between two waveforms. For GW data $d(t)$ and normalized theoretical waveforms $\hat h_b(t)$,

\begin{equation}
    \rho = \max_\text{params} \left( d(t), \hat h_b (t)\right), \label{SNR}
\end{equation}
where $(,)$ is the inner product defined by
\begin{equation}
    (h_1, h_2) = 4 \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\tilde h_1^* (f)
    \tilde h_2 (f)}{S_n(f)}df.
\end{equation}
This quantity is to be maximized over all parameters of the waveform. A GW is ``detected'' if the SNR is above a set minimum.

The template bank is discrete and so
cannot encompass every waveform in the continuous parameter
space. Additionally, the waveform approximants used to construct
the template bank may not accurately represent the actual waveforms from binaries.  These effects of the discreteness of template banks and use of waveform approximants are represented by the fitting factor (FF),
\begin{equation}
    \text{FF} = \max_\text{template bank}
    \left ( \hat{h}_s(t), \hat{h}_b(t)\right ),
\end{equation}
where $h_s$ is the signal waveform and $h_b$ is the template bank waveform.

The fitting factor also gives us a measure of how well a template bank can recover signal waveforms, since a greater fitting factor would mean greater SNR would be recovered. This is known as the effectualness of a template bank.  

\subsection{Geometric Placement of Template Banks} \label{GeomTmplBank}
Template bank generating algorithms have the purpose of generating the minimum number of waveforms such that any waveform in that parameter space can be recovered with a fitting factor of 0.97 or higher.
{\red Explain that 0.97 is chosen so that no more than  X\% of signals
are missed.}

Start by defining
\begin{equation}
    O(h_1, h_2) = \left( \hat{h}_1, \hat{h}_2\right)
\end{equation}
as the normalized overlap between two waveforms. Let $\lambda$ be a point in the parameter space and $\lambda + \Delta\lambda$ be a point very close to the first point ($\Delta\lambda \approx $ 0).
Then, the overlap for waveforms at these two points can be written as,
\begin{equation}
    O(h(\lambda), h(\lambda + \Delta\lambda)) \approx 1 + \frac{1}{2} \left (\frac{\partial^2O}{\partial\Delta\lambda^i \; \partial\Delta\lambda^j} \right) \delta\lambda^i \delta\lambda^j
\end{equation}
where the zeroth-order value of the overlap is 1 since this term corresponds to the inner product of $(h(\lambda), h(\lambda))$, for $\Delta\lambda = 0$. Setting the second term
 to $-g_{ij}\delta\lambda^i \delta\lambda^j$ allows us to define a metric $g_{ij}$ used to find the points in the template bank.

In the case where a template bank is constructed with non-spinning binary systems, the metric is represented in $\tau_0$, $\tau_3$ coordinates,~\cite{TmplBank}
\begin{equation}
    \tau_0 = \frac{5}{265 \pi f_0 \eta}\left(\frac{\pi G M f_0}{c^3}
    \right)^{-5/3} \qquad
     \tau_3 = \frac{5}{8 f_0 \eta} \left( \frac{\pi G M f_0}{c^3}\right)^{-2/3},
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{equation}
    \eta = \frac{m_1 m_2}{(m_1 + m_2)^2}, \label{Eta}
\end{equation}
and $f_0$ is the lower frequency cutoff used in generating the waveforms. \\
 The reason for this choice is that the metric is more cartesian in these coordinates.
 Figure~\ref{fig:mtau} shows a template bank for
non-spinning binary black holes in $m_1$, $m_2$ coordinates and $\tau_0$, $\tau_3$ coordinates. The points in the $\tau_0 - \tau_3$ plot are more uniformly distributed as compared to the $m_1 - m_2$ plot.

\subsection{Effectualness of Template Banks}

We computed the effectualness of a template bank consisting of EOBNRv2 waveforms for input signals from EOBNRv2 and TaylorF2 waveforms.
The template bank was constructed using the method described in Section \ref{GeomTmplBank} for non-spinning binaries with component masses $3$ -- $25\,M_{\odot}$. The plot of fitting factors for EOBNRv2 waveform signals is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:effectualnessEOB}.
In this case, the regions with lower fitting factors reflect
the lack of template waveforms in those regions, while the points with
FF close to 1 coincide with the points in the template bank. This
is clearer from the second plot in $\eta-\mathcal{M}$ coordinates, where $\eta$ is defined in Eq. \ref{EtaF0} and $\mathcal{M}$ is the chirp mass and can be written in terms of the reduced mass $\mu = \frac{m_1 m_2}{M}$ as,
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{M} = \mu^{3/5} M^{2/5},
\end{equation}
and $M$ is the total mass.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{EffectualnessEOBNRv2.png}
        \label{fig:effectualnessEOBm1m2}

    \end{minipage}
    \caption{Fitting Factor of EOBNRv2 signal waveforms in $m_1$-$m_2$
    coordinates and $\eta$-$\mathcal{M}$ coordinates}
    \label{fig:effectualnessEOB}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:effectualnessTaylorF2} shows the FF of TaylorF2 signal waveforms. The FF here decreases for larger total mass $M$ which could be because the PN approximated waveforms only contain the inspiral
waveform. These waveforms have a high frequency cutoff at the ISCO
(innermost stable circular orbit) where the adiabatic approximation
is no longer valid. Since high total mass binaries have a shorter
inspiral period, this is not sufficient to approximate the waveform.

\end{figure}

For full waveforms including the merger, phenomenological models are used. These are constructed using PN approximated waveforms tuned to numerical relativity for merger and ringdown terms.
